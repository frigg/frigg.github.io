## Approval
Since frigg is in a beta phase all projects need approval before they can be
built on. If you think it is taking way to long before your project is
approved you can send us a mail at hi@frigg.io.

## About Github permissions
We ask for write permissions to your repositories. We actually do not want to,
however there is no way around this. Github does not have a permission scope in
their API that gives read-only access to repositories. We try our best to keep
the scope of the permissions we ask for at a minimum.
